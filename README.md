**Phasmophobia is a 4-player, online co-op, psychological horror game. Players take on the role of paranormal investigators who must enter haunted locations and identify the type of ghost haunting the location. The game features a variety of ghost types, each with their own unique behaviors and weaknesses. Players must use a variety of equipment to gather evidence of the ghost's presence, such as EMF readers, spirit boxes, and thermometers. Once they have gathered enough evidence, players can attempt to identify the type of ghost and complete their objective. This project was created with the aim of helping players become proficient in the game.**
